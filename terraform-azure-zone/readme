# Secure Landing Zone with Terraform

## Overview

This Terraform project automates the deployment of a secure landing zone in Microsoft Azure. The landing zone is designed to create a well-architected and secure foundation for other resources and workloads.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into modules for better modularity and reusability:

- `networking`: Defines virtual networks, subnets, and VNET peering.
- `compute`: Placeholder for compute resources (e.g., VMs).
- `security`: Placeholder for security-related resources (e.g., NSGs, route tables).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed.
- Azure subscription and credentials configured.
